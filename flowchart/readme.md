This directory contains flowcharts that can be used as guides for deciding which PQC algorithms to use and what criteria to rely on when planning the migration.
Each flowchart is drawn by assuming that the probability of compromise of the PQC algorithm is low, medium or high.
The likelihood of cryptography being compromised falls into three categories: low, medium, or high. Our attention is solely on the cryptographic aspect, assuming that the implementation of composite signatures is validated and reliable.
